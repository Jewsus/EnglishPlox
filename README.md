English, plox.
===========

English, plox is a simple plugin for TSAPI that kicks people that have characters in their name 
that aren't on a standard US-keyboard.  Terraria's console interface makes it extremely hard to 
manage players that have characters that are easily typed on a non-US keyboard, so this plugin
enforces people to have standard reduced-set ASCII characters in their character names only.

List of allowed characters in names:

* A-Z
* 0-9
* !@#$%^&*()_+-~`;:{}[]|.,

List of denied characters in names:

* Everything else
